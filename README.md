# Toy Recognition and Story Builder

A Kivy-based application that uses real-time object detection to recognize toys via your device's camera and helps children build creative stories around the recognized toys.

## Features

- **Real-time Toy Recognition:** Uses YOLO object detection to identify toys from the camera feed every 0.5 seconds.
- **Story Builder:** Prompts children to create and narrate stories based on the recognized toys.
- **Interactive UI:** Simple, child-friendly interface built with Kivy.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable for new features, screens, and widgets.
